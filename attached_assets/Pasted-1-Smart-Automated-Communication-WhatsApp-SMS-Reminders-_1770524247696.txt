1. Smart Automated Communication

WhatsApp/SMS Reminders: Automatically send polite payment reminders to customers with pending "Udhaar" when they reach their due date.


Automated Invoicing: Generate and send digital receipts via WhatsApp or email immediately after a sale is recorded.

2. Advanced AI & Analytics

AI Business Insights: Use rule-based or AI models to provide insights like "Sales dropped 12% this week" or "Avoid giving credit to [Customer Name]" based on their history.


Predictive Inventory: Analyze sales trends to suggest when the shop owner should restock specific items before they run out.


Trust Score Evolution: Enhance the "Trust Score" by using an AI model that considers payment delays, frequency of borrowing, and total purchase volume.

3. Financial & Operational Tools

Expense Tracking: Allow owners to record shop expenses (rent, electricity, supplier payments) to calculate actual net profit, not just total sales.


Multi-User Support: Add "Staff Accounts" with limited permissions so employees can record sales, but only the owner can see the full profit/loss dashboard.


Supplier Management: A section to track how much the shop owner owes to their own suppliers, similar to the customer borrowing tracking.

4. Accessibility & UI Enhancements

Voice Commands: Since the goal is "insanely easy" use, adding voice-to-text for adding sales (e.g., "Add 500 rupees for Ramesh") would be a major advantage for busy shop owners.


Offline Mode: Enable the website (as a PWA) to work offline so owners can record sales even if the internet is down, syncing later when connected.


Multi-Language Support: Provide the interface in local languages to make it more accessible to small business owners who may not be comfortable with English.

5. Reporting & Exports

Custom Report Generation: Allow owners to export detailed PDF or Excel reports for specific date ranges for tax or accounting purposes.


Daily Summary: Send an automated end-of-day summary to the owner’s phone showing total sales, collections, and new borrowings for that day.
