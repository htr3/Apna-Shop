1. Smart Automated Communication

WhatsApp Reminders: Automatically send polite payment reminders to customers with pending "Udhaar" when they reach their due date.


Automated Digital Receipts: Generate and send digital receipts via WhatsApp or email immediately after a sale is recorded.

2. Advanced AI & Analytics

Automated Insights: Implement a feature that provides rule-based or AI-driven insights, such as "Sales dropped 12% this week" or "Avoid giving credit to [Customer Name]".


Predictive Inventory (Future AI): Analyze sales trends to suggest when the shop owner should restock specific items before they run out.


AI-Driven Trust Score: Enhance the "Trust Score" by using an AI model that considers payment delays, frequency of borrowing, and total purchase volume more dynamically.

3. Financial & Operational Tools

Expense Tracking: Allow owners to record shop expenses (rent, electricity, supplier payments) to calculate actual net profit.


Multi-User/Staff Support: Add "Staff Accounts" with limited permissions so employees can record sales, but only the owner can access the full profit/loss dashboard.


Supplier Management: A section to track how much the shop owner owes to their own suppliers, mirroring the customer borrowing tracking system.

4. Accessibility & UI Enhancements

Voice Commands: Add voice-to-text functionality for adding sales (e.g., "Add 500 rupees for Ramesh") to make it "insanely easy" for busy shop owners.


Offline Mode: Enable the website as a Progressive Web App (PWA) so owners can record sales without internet, syncing later.


Multi-Language Support: Provide the interface in local languages to assist owners who may not be comfortable with English.

5. Reporting & Exports

Exportable Reports: Enable owners to export detailed PDF or Excel reports for specific date ranges, useful for tax or accounting purposes.


Daily Summaries: Send an automated end-of-day summary to the owner’s phone showing total sales, collections, and new borrowings
